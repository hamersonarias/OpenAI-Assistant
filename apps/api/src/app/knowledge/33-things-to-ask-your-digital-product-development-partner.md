See this list of must-ask questions for potential collaborators, and a set of top-tips which will help you in your selection process.


#### GENERAL QUESTIONS

**Why are you better than other, similar companies?**
Pro tip: What is the unique “thing” they have to offer to you? If the only thing they have to offer is an attractive price, then be careful.

**What’s your experience in digital product design and development?**
Pro tip: Experience should not be the only indicator to take into account, but years of activity on the market and a long list of created products are desirable assets.

**What’s your experience working with clients of my industry/size/type/region?**
Pro tip: The more experience they have in a similar industry or even region, the more insights and quality they can put into your product and organization.

**How can I find information about your previous collaborations?**
Pro tip: A company with successfully delivered digital products will have a rich portfolio of well-documented and data-driven case studies to read and see.

**Where can I find your previous partner’s opinions on how you collaborate?**
Pro tip: Look for honest and reliable reviews and opinions, and not only thoseon their own website. Services like Clutch.co are good sources of reliable testimonials.

**What are the next steps after product release?**
Pro tip: Check they have a clear process for the product’s further development and maintenance.

**What kind of contracts do you work with?**
Pro tip: Look up for those giving you the most freedom when changing priorities during the product development process, but at the same time allowing you to sleep well because you know exactly how much money you are spending. The time and materials (T&M) model would be the best option in this case.

#### WORKFLOW:

**How do you usually start a collaboration, what are the first steps?**
Pro tip: Examine their setup process for a new partner and how they will react to, care about and answer your needs. Some companies may offer you a brief discovery workshop for better understanding of your needs, expectations and business goals - every proactive action is a good sign.

**What are the usual challenges (like major technical issues, lack of human resources, other problems) we may expect and how do you dealing with them?**
Pro tip: Ask are they prepared for most common kinds of problems and do they have processes to deal with them?

**How flexible you are regarding adding new features and additions to the scope?**
Pro tip: See how adjustable their approach to new ideas, out-of-the-box solutions and general changes is. Most likely, your product will be slightly different than the original concept, and its backlog will grow quickly.

**Are you going to use any external companies to work on my product?**
Pro tip: Be sure not to fall into a so-called white labeling situation when the collaborator outsources part of the works to a cheaper and usually less reliable solution provider. This will affect the final quality of your product.

**How do you define transparency in your organization and development process?**
Pro tip: If you want to be always up to date with the project’s progress, you need to be sure that you have 24/7 access to both the vital components and also the knowledge base of the product. This means access to the proper tools but also assigned, personal points of contact.

**Do you have experience working with in-house dev or design teams?**
Pro tip: Test whether they have experience in co-working between internal teams and how they handle it. From your point of view, this is an amazing opportunity for instant knowledge transfer.

**Will I be the legitimate owner of the source code after the development work is done?**
Pro tip: This is a crucial issue that needs to be taken into account: what will happen with the written code when it’s time to finish the contract.

**What is your definition of “done” when it comes to a developed digital product?**
Pro tip: Make sure you are all on the same page and make sure definitions are clear and acceptable for both sides.

#### METHODOLOGY AND TOOLS:
**What communication and project management tools do you use on a daily basis?**
Pro tip: Check if they use modern and safe tools, and make sure there will be no communication problems because of a prefered (by one side or the other) toolset.

**What framework/methodology do you use during your product development process?**
Pro tip: Let’s get one thing straight: the waterfall model is obsolete and inefficient. Focus on agile and scrum-backed collaborators that will give you more room for adjustments.

**How will you keep me updated about work progress?**
Pro tip: Set rules on how often you want to be informed of progress and events during the whole process.

**Do you have a single point of contact at your end or can I discuss issues directly with the development team?**
Pro tip: To avoid “Hmm, who should I ask to get this done” situations ask for a direct contact to someone who will be able to help you with questions. It doesn’t have to be one, dedicated person, as long as you will get what you need within a reasonable time.

**How fast can I see a working piece of my product?**
Pro tip: While the development process is not easy, it’s not rocket science. You should expect to see results, in the form of a working piece of code, within the first or second sprint.

**Which type of products do you have experience with?**
Pro tip: Make sure that your potential partner knows how to work on different product types, like MVPs or prototypes, among others.

**How do you protect your (my) data?**
Pro tip: What tools and technology do they use to keep your property safe from variable problems?

**What is your approximate delivery time?**
Pro tip: Ask if you want to make sure their calculations are based on previous experience, and not wishful thinking.

**What technologies do you use?**
Pro tip: If you’re looking for a partner to maintain, scale or add features to an existing product, make sure they have the required knowledge and experience in the necessary technologies.

**Who will be assigned to my project, can I meet the team?**
Pro tip: Transparency is essential while working with external partners, and knowing who will work on your product is extremely important. Mutual trust influences quality and final results of the project.

**How do you assure quality of the code and other components of the product?**
Pro tip: There are plenty of ways of checking if the emerging digital product meets high standards, not only from the code perspective. Ask your potential partner about unit tests, functional tests, smoke tests, user interface tests, user experience tests, regression tests, security audits, performance tests and manual acceptance testing. Not all of them are universal but combined, they will make the difference

**Will your team be focused only on my product, or it will be working simultaneously on other things?**
Pro tip: Make sure your external team will be devoted only to your project and nothing will distract them from the main goal.

**How will you assure me during the product development that everything is going well?**
Pro tip: Mutual relations are essential while working on such complex products. Make sure you can visit your collaborator, meet the team and see the product in the making.

**How safe, taking in account infrastructure of different kinds (internet connectivity, secure and interrupted electric grid, recurring and unpredictable weather conditions) is your office?**
Pro tip: You’re looking for the most profitable offer but don’t forget to pay attention to the geographical and political situation in your partner’s country. Most likely, the cheapest offer won’t guarantee final success and may carry some risk.

#### COSTS:

**Do you charge per hour, per month or per team?**
Pro tip: There are many ways to charge for work and you should choose the most suitable for you. However, the most beneficial one is to hire a dedicated team, including developers and designers - you can be sure that such a team will be focused solely on your product, guaranteeing you quality and efficiency.

**What is your hourly rate? How do you charge for the work done?**
Pro tip: Once again, an experienced collaborator should have no problems with providing a clear and plain price plan.

**Do you provide Project Managers to support the project development and if yes, at what cost?**
Pro Tip: You definitely want to be kept informed of the progress of works and be up to date with everything. A Product Manager or dedicated Scrum Master should take care of issues like budget tracking and development progress. Ask if the potential partner provides this kind of assistance and at what cost.
